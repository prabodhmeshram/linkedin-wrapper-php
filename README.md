linkedin-wrapper-php
====================

A wrapper Class in PHP for LinkedIn API.

To use this wrapper class, you need to create a developer account with LinkedIn and get API_KEY and API_SECRET.

At the moment the wrapper only supports retrieval of auth token. More user info fetching methods will be added soon.
